"555555555","6301","tilman","Completed","Assessment","Blue and John Crow Mountains","Direct association with outstanding historical events","6","There is a legal possibility of mineral exploration and extraction despite national park status. According to applicable national park regulations, mining is only illegal when occurring ""without written permission of the Authority"" (JCDT, 2011). The management plan notes prospecting licenses which were apparently granted prior to the formal establishment of the national park. Given the direct vicinity of the property and the larger national park to Jamaica's capital some observers have pointed out that there are incentives to extract construction material from the national park even though the Forest Act stipulates that extraction of ""soil, sand or gravel"" are not permitted (JCDT, 2011).","Energy Production and Mining","Mining/ Quarrying","2014"
"555555555","6301","tilman","Completed","Assessment","Blue and John Crow Mountains","Direct association with outstanding historical events","6","It is impossible to quantify the future impacts and there is no clear analysis of existing impacts which may be attributable to climate change. The current management plan plausibly argues that climate change is likely to increase the effects of existing impacts, such as land degradation which per se are not caused by climate change (JDCT, 2011). Detailed research by Bellingham et al. (1995, 1994, 1992) indicates that the remaining intact montane forests were remarkably resilient to Hurricane Gilbert which heavily hit Jamaica in 1988.

There appear to be issues requiring clarification surrounding conflicting interpretations of formal versus customary land tenure and there communal land tenure on the part of Maroon communities (JCDT, 2011). One particularity of the property and the national park are land rights granted to companies and war veterans by the Forestry Department. Some appear to remain active and the implications appear to be interpreted in differing ways. According to the management plan, the ""system of leases within the park is a complex issue involving many sub-leases and numerous parties"" (JCDT, 2011). As a concrete example, the same source makes reference to land leased to the Coffee Industry Development Company (CIDCO), which apparently sub-leased land to private individuals.","Low Threat","1","1","2014"

According to applicable national park regulations, mining is only illegal when occurring ""without written permission of the Authority"" (JCDT, 2011). The management plan notes prospecting licenses which were apparently granted prior to the formal establishment of the national park. Given the direct vicinity of the property and the larger national park to Jamaica's capital some observers have pointed out that there are incentives to extract construction material from the national park even though the Forest Act stipulates that extraction of ""soil, sand or gravel"" are not permitted (JCDT, 2011).","Low Threat","1","1","2014"

There is a well-managed visitor centre and recreation area (Holywell) easily accessible from the capital city of Kingston and a number of well-known trails, such as the renowned Blue Mountain Peak Trail. Limited numbers of hikers enter the few trails into the more remote areas of the property. There are risks in terms of impacts on the extremely small grasslands on the highest peaks, which are both exceptionally valuable and vulnerable. Visitors also increase the likelihood of fires and the spreading of invasive species and there is localized littering. Visitor education and patrolling can help reduce such risks. There is apparently some interest in expanding the network of hiking trails so as to make additional remote peaks accessible which are rarely, if ever, visited today. This would put the unique plant communities of the highest elevations at risk.","Low Threat","1","1","2014"

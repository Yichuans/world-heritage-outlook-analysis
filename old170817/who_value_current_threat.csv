In the deforested and/or degraded lower elevations of the national park, which serves as the buffer zone of the property, and on adjacent land, invasive plants are omnipresent and in many places hyper-abundant, for example Bracken Fern and Wild Ginger. The nomination dossier singles out Pittosporum undulatum, an Australian tree species sometimes called Mock Orange, as particularly damaging by out-competing native trees and thereby preventing natural forest regeneration (Jamaican Government, 2014, see also Goodland et al. 1996). With the exception of higher elevations in remote and rugged locations with intact native vegetation, even the property itself is affected by a large number of invasive species. There are also remnants of domestic species stemming from past agriculture and failed attempts to establish timber plantations using non-native pine species. An additional concern is that non-native grasses, such as Molasses or Wynne Grass (Melinus minutiflora) and bamboo species may provide entry points for fire. Fire is commonly used in the agricultural areas around the property.

The following brief overview draws on CEPF (2010), Goodland et al. (1996), IUCN (2015), Jamaican Government (2014), JCDT (2011) and references therein. There are more than 10 recorded non-native mammals in the property, which include rats, mongoose, feral pigs and dogs and possibly white-tailed deer, all well-known to heavily impact on island systems across the world. In the deforested and/or degraded lower elevations of the national park, which serves as the buffer zone of the property, and on adjacent land, invasive plants are omnipresent and in many places hyper-abundant, for example Bracken Fern and Wild Ginger. The nomination dossier singles out Pittosporum undulatum, an Australian tree species sometimes called Mock Orange, as particularly damaging by out-competing native trees and thereby preventing natural forest regeneration (Jamaican Government, 2014, see also Goodland et al. 1996). With the exception of higher elevations in remote and rugged locations with intact native vegetation, even the property itself is affected by a large number of invasive species. There are also remnants of domestic species stemming from past agriculture and failed attempts to establish timber plantations using non-native pine species. An additional concern is that non-native grasses, such as Molasses or Wynne Grass (Melinus minutiflora) and bamboo species may provide entry points for fire. Fire is commonly used in the agricultural areas around the property. It is believed that the Maroon, and possibly indigenous Peoples prior and during the times of maroonage, influenced species distribution by promoting or planting preferred species for use as food or medicine.","Invasive and Other Problematic Species and Genes","Invasive Non-Native/ Alien Species","2014"

JCDT (2011) argues that such unexpected cultivation in hardly accessible remote areas is a response to fear of crop theft.","Agriculture and Aquaculture","Crops","2014"

Numerous unformed and informal side tracks, used by four wheel drive vehicles, leave the main highway, some penetrating into the WH property, especially in the Shur valley. The river floods occasionally and vehicle tracks across its sometimes muddy floodplain leave a web of intertwining ruts across the desert floor. The threat is that with pressure from more vehicles in the future there will be further expansion and erosion of landscape values around the boundary of the park.","Transportation and Service Corridors","Roads/ Railroads","2017"

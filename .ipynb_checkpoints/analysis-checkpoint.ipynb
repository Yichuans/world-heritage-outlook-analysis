    "\n",
    "The 2017 cycle of assessments will not be ready until later September/October. This notebook is an attempt to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Experiment the methodology that allows rapid analysis to be repeated with little efforts. The goal is to complete the analysis within short time, when the final data have become available\n",
    "2. Experiment open and reproducible analysis that anyone interested could critique, repeat or improve the methodolgy if they so wish\n",
    "3. Test ideas and scrutise the result, to uncover inconsistency and enable future iterations of outlook assessment to be more systematic and consistent\n",
    "\n",
    "### The analysis so far\n",
    "- load CSV data (pre-processed data dumps from PostgreSQL/MS Access) into the notebook\n",
    "- utility functions to find relevant rows in the data, based on `wdpaid` and `assessment_cycle`\n",
    "- generic summary statistics (using `pandas.DataFrame.pivot_table`), for the `overall` table, notably including the `outlook` ratings. This is implemented so that any dataframe with filtered rows could be done easily, i.e., allowing subsetting by regions, countries, any attribute criteria\n",
    "- generic field-by-field change detction for the `overall` table. This is useful to identify the lowest level change (i.e. field level change for each site) but also provides a mechanism for quality control as odd changes that should not happen could be easily identified\n",
    "- generic pivot table counting for any data. I tested the functionality using `potential_threat`, in which different groups of threat categories are needed\n",
    "- viz: outlook, and its comparison\n",
    "- viz: heatmap for threats, the charts are interactive, allowing users to interrogate each cell (powered by Plot.ly)\n",
    "- finding associations between values, pm and threats to the final outlook rating\n",
    "- finding inconsistencies between individual threat listing and severity to the final threat rating \n",
    "- find sites and analyse based on internal filters, such as specific threats or management\n",
    "- regional filters are now in place for the overall table\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Ideas\n",
    "- attribute filters: regions, marine, country, WH criteria, danger status. This could be easily implemented as the only change would be the input. As long as the analysis is designed in such a way that allow such input to be changed at a later stage."

    "\n",
    "One inherent weakness of the Outlook process is the qualitative methods employed to assess outlook and its three components, values, threats and management. While contrast and variation of rating is possible by broad categories, i.e. High, Very High to Low, they are not accurate and do not capture differences that may be subtle but signifcant, within and across sites. Additionally, the variety of assessors and reviewers, despite the benefits brought by the diversity and broad coverage of talent pools from across the globe, may also undermine the impartiality of assessments when criteria may be subjectively or inconsistently applied. This is further restricted by the need to classify into limited categories. At this late stage, little can be done to remedy or adjust the uncertainty and the improvement may require systematically revisiting the methodology and significant restructures, notably requiring more quantitative measures. It is important that we do not overlook this exercise as it determines the long term viability as a comparable, impartial metric that can measure the wellbing and outlook for natural World Heritage sites.\n",

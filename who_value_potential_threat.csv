Given the direct vicinity of the property and the larger national park to Jamaica's capital some observers have pointed out that there are incentives to extract construction material from the national park even though the Forest Act stipulates that extraction of ""soil, sand or gravel"" are not permitted (JCDT, 2011).","Energy Production and Mining","Mining/ Quarrying","2014"

There appear to be issues requiring clarification surrounding conflicting interpretations of formal versus customary land tenure and there communal land tenure on the part of Maroon communities (JCDT, 2011). One particularity of the property and the national park are land rights granted to companies and war veterans by the Forestry Department. Some appear to remain active and the implications appear to be interpreted in differing ways. According to the management plan, the ""system of leases within the park is a complex issue involving many sub-leases and numerous parties"" (JCDT, 2011).
